This node server takes a snapshot of the lighting type device status and can then later restore the devices to those values.

Lighting devices are those devices that have a status value using the unit-of-measure for level (0-255) or percent.  This should cover most Insteon switch/lamp modules and Z-wave switch/lamp modules.

## Installation

1. Backup Your ISY in case of problems!
   * Really, do the backup, please
2. Go to the Polyglot Store in the UI and install.
3. Add NodeServer in Polyglot Web
   * After the install completes, Polyglot will reboot your ISY, you can watch the status in the main polyglot log.
4. Once your ISY is back up open the Admin Console.
5. Configure the node server with the ISY ip address, username, and password
